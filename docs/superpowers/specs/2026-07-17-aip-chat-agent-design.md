# AIP Chat Agent (Streamlit) — Design Doc

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Status:** Draft for review
**Owner:** Gen-AI Content team, NxtWave
**Implements:** §4.4 (Chat agent) and §6 (Learning loop) of [Academic Intelligence Platform design](2026-07-10-academic-intelligence-platform-design.md)

---

## 1. Problem & Goal

The canonical store now holds content, sessions, feedback, the course catalogue, and (after this work) delivered scheduling and the designed HLID/Prod sequence. Answering questions against it currently requires someone who can write SQL and knows the join-key quirks.

**Goal:** a ChatGPT-style Streamlit app where the team asks **any question the data can answer**, in plain English, and gets a grounded answer — and which improves from per-answer feedback.

This is a **general-purpose Q&A agent over the whole store**, not a deviation tool. Deviation is one of many things it should handle. The agent must be equally able to answer, for example:
- *"How many coding questions exist for Data Structures using C++?"* (content)
- *"Which instructors have the lowest session completion rate?"* (operational)
- *"Which sessions at CDU rated below 3 for teaching quality?"* (feedback)
- *"What courses are in the FullStack stack and what are their prerequisites?"* (catalogue)
- *"Which units were delivered late at MRV vs the plan?"* (deviation)
- *"What should we change in Sem 1 next year?"* (advisory)

The design must not privilege any one question shape. Coverage of the **schema** is what determines capability.

**Non-goals (v1):**
- **Self-improvement.** Feedback is captured but not fed back into the agent's behaviour. Deferred to v2 (§13) — we want to see what people actually ask, and whether answers are good, before teaching it anything.
- Model fine-tuning, ever. If the loop returns it will be prompt-context, not training.
- Writing to any source system. The agent is strictly read-only.
- Quoting student free-text feedback (see §7).
- Replacing the fortnightly report or the recommendation queue.

## 2. Scope decisions (confirmed)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Question types | All: analytics/metrics, content lookup, and open-ended advisory |
| How it answers | Tool-calling agent with a read-only SQL tool (not single-shot text-to-SQL, not a fixed metrics library) |
| Data scope | Everything: existing canonical + **new** delivered scheduling + **new** designed HLID/Prod sequence |
| Improvement loop | **Capture only in v1.** Per-response feedback is recorded; nothing is fed back automatically. Deferred (§13). |
| Semester scope | Load delivered Sem 1 **and** Sem 2; designed data is Sem 1 only, so the agent says so when asked to compare Sem 2 |
| Hosting | Streamlit Community Cloud |
| Student comment text | **Not exposed to the agent** (ratings + counts only) |

## 3. Architecture

```
Streamlit chat UI (app.py)
      │ question + history
      ▼
Agent loop (aip/agent.py) ──► OpenRouter /chat/completions (tool-calling)
      │  system prompt = data dictionary + caveats   (static in v1)
      │  tool: run_sql(query)
      ▼
DuckDB read-only (aip/db.py) — aip.duckdb rebuilt at startup from committed data
      │  content_* · sessions · session_feedback_safe · courses · course_crosswalk
      │  + delivered_sessions + designed_sequence + designed_course_plan + deviation view
      ▼
answer + SQL trace → UI renders answer, "show SQL", 👍/👎, "What could be improved?"
      │
      ▼
Google Sheet (aip/feedback.py): feedback_log        ← write-only in v1; humans read it
```

**The feedback path is one-way in v1.** Nothing read from the Sheet re-enters the prompt. The arrow back into the agent is deliberately absent — see §13.

**Why a tool-calling agent:** one mechanism covers all three question types — analytics are aggregations, content lookup is a select, advisory is query-then-reason. It can iterate (query → look → refine), which single-shot text-to-SQL cannot.

**Why Google Sheets:** Streamlit Community Cloud has an **ephemeral filesystem** — it wipes on redeploy/sleep, so feedback written to a local file would silently vanish. A Sheet survives restarts, is human-reviewable, and matches how the team already works. This is the only reason the Sheet exists in v1: durable storage for feedback humans will read.

## 4. Data layer

### 4.1 New committed tables

| Artifact | Built by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `data/canonical/delivered_sessions.parquet` | `scripts/build_delivered.py` | institute_name, batch_section, semester, session_id, session_title, session_type, resource_type, unit_id, start_ts, end_ts, instructor_name, instructor_category, session_status, course_title |
| `data/canonical/designed_sequence.csv` | `scripts/build_designed.py` | university, course, topic, unit_id, week, planned_start, session_name, type, seq |
| `data/canonical/designed_course_plan.csv` | `scripts/build_designed.py` | university, course, sessions_count, session_hours, practice_hours, micro_assessment_hours, start_timeline, end_timeline, weeks_required |

**Parquet for `delivered_sessions`:** ~396K rows would be a ~50 MB CSV; Parquet compresses to a few MB, carries types (no Excel-serial re-parsing), and DuckDB reads it natively. Matters on a 1 GB Streamlit Cloud box. The other two tables are small — CSV, consistent with the existing canonical layout.

**Excel serials are converted at build time** (epoch 1899-12-30) so `start_ts`/`end_ts`/`planned_start` are real timestamps. The agent must never see a raw serial.

### 4.2 Extensions to `scripts/load_duckdb.py`

- Load the three new artifacts.
- Keep the existing `content_units` view.
- `session_feedback_safe` view — `session_feedback` **minus** the `positive_feedbacks` / `neutral_feedbacks` / `negative_feedbacks` comment-text columns; exposes ratings and `total_feedbacks` only. The agent is pointed at this view, never the base table (§7).
- `deviation` view — a **convenience view**, one of several. It encodes the designed↔delivered join (on `unit_id`, per university) so the agent need not reinvent the trickiest join in the store. Columns: university, course, unit_id, planned_start, actual_start, drift_days, status (`delivered` / `dropped` / `added`).

Views exist to pre-solve joins the agent would otherwise get wrong. `deviation` is the first because it is the hardest — not because deviation questions matter more than others. Add further views only when a real question proves a join is being fumbled repeatedly.

### 4.3 Data dictionary (the asset that makes "any question" work)

`docs/data-dictionary.md` — a maintained description of **every table and column**: what it means, its grain, its allowed values, and its join keys. This file is injected into the system prompt verbatim.

This is the highest-leverage artifact in the design. A general-purpose agent is only as capable as its schema knowledge: without being told that `unit_id` is the universal key, that `session_id` is stored dash-less, that `course_crosswalk` is required to bridge course titles, or that `session_type` is coarse, the agent will silently write plausible wrong SQL. Schema coverage — not clever prompting — is what determines how many questions it can answer.

It is generated from the live DuckDB schema (tables/columns/types) and hand-annotated with meanings and the join-key contract, so it cannot drift silently from the database.

### 4.4 Known data caveats the agent must be told

These go into the system prompt verbatim, because they change how answers should be read.

**Join-key contract (applies to every question):**
- `unit_id` is the universal key across content, delivered, designed, and feedback. It is the spine — prefer it.
- `session_id` is stored **dash-less** (32-hex) in `sessions` and `delivered_sessions`. Feedback is normalized to match; never join on a dashed UUID.
- Course titles do **not** join directly. `course_crosswalk` is required to bridge delivered ↔ catalogue ↔ content; only ~50% of delivered session volume maps, the rest are `unmapped`. Course counts taken without the crosswalk will be wrong.
- There is **no Subject entity**; `stack` in `courses` is the closest roll-up.

**Coverage / quality caveats (state these when they affect an answer):**
- Content exists for only ~15 course titles of 63 in the catalogue, and reaches ~19% of delivered units. "No content found" usually means *not ingested*, not *doesn't exist*.
- Fine unit types (classroom quiz / mcq / coding practice / module quiz / reading) are **not** a field — delivered data has only coarse LECTURE/PRACTICE/EXAM × LP_RESOURCE/LP_QUIZ. Finer types are only inferable from the content tables, for the ~19% covered.
- ~30% of content units are never scheduled in any delivery.
- Prod-Sequence `unit_id` coverage varies by university (MRV ~82%, SGU ~65%, Yenepoya/CDU ~40%). Low coverage means an **incomplete design export**, not curriculum improvisation — so `status='added'` is unreliable for Yenepoya/CDU.
- Planned dates exist only for MRV; others are derived from `Week` + HLID semester start. MRV's Prod Sequence also mixes an original and a "NEW BATCH" re-plan.

**Behavioural rule:** when a caveat materially affects an answer, the agent states it alongside the number. A confident number built on a known-broken join is worse than a caveated one.

## 5. Agent layer

**`aip/db.py`** — read-only DuckDB connection.
- `run_sql(query) -> rows` guardrails: **SELECT/WITH only** (reject DDL/DML by statement parse, not regex-only), row cap (1,000), statement timeout (10s), result truncation note when capped.
- Guardrails are a trust boundary: the tool argument is model-generated text. This is not a place to be lazy.

**`aip/agent.py`** — OpenRouter tool-calling loop.
- `answer(question, history) -> (text, sql_trace)`.
- Model is a config value (`MODEL` secret), not hardcoded — per the parent design doc's per-agent model config.
- Max 5 tool iterations, then answer with what it has or say it couldn't.
- System prompt = **`docs/data-dictionary.md` (§4.3)** + §4.4 caveats. **Static in v1** — no learned content.
- The prompt is deliberately schema-heavy and instruction-light: breadth of question coverage comes from the agent knowing the data, not from task-specific prompting.

**`aip/feedback.py`** — Google Sheets append via service account.
- `log_feedback(row)` — append one row to `feedback_log`. That is the whole module in v1.
- Write-only. Nothing is read back into the agent.

## 6. UI & the feedback loop

**`app.py`** — `st.chat_message` / `st.chat_input`.

Every assistant response renders, in order:
1. The answer text.
2. A collapsed **"Show SQL"** expander with the query/queries run.
3. **👍 / 👎** buttons.
4. An optional free-text box: **"What could be improved?"**
5. Submit.

Feedback is **per response**, not per session. Each submission appends one `feedback_log` row: timestamp, question, sql, answer, verdict (up/down/none), improvement_text, model.

**What happens to it in v1: nothing automatic.** The row lands in the Sheet and a human reads it. The agent's behaviour is unchanged by feedback.

The row captures everything needed to wire a loop later (question, the exact SQL, the answer, the verdict, and what the user wanted instead), so deferring the loop costs us no data — only time. See §13.

## 7. Security & data handling

- **Student comment text is never exposed to the agent.** It queries `session_feedback_safe` (ratings + counts). Reason: the app deploys from a GitHub repo to third-party infra; free-text student complaints are the most sensitive thing in the store and add little to the analytics/advisory questions this app serves.
- **OpenRouter key** lives in `st.secrets` (Streamlit Cloud Secrets in prod, gitignored `.streamlit/secrets.toml` locally). Never client-side, never committed.
- **Service-account JSON** likewise in secrets.
- **Repo must be private** and the Streamlit app's viewers restricted to org emails.
- **Pre-existing exposure (action required, outside this design):** `data/canonical/session_feedback.csv` already contains comment text and is already pushed to GitHub. If the repo is public, that text is already exposed, and `session_feedback_safe` does not undo git history. Verify repo visibility; making it private is step one. Purging history is a separate task.

## 8. Error handling

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| SQL error | Feed the error back to the model for **one** repair retry; if it still fails, surface the failed SQL and say it couldn't answer. Never guess a number. |
| Non-SELECT generated | Guardrail rejects; the model is told why and may retry once. |
| Empty result | Answer "no rows matched" and show the SQL. Never fabricate rows. |
| OpenRouter error/timeout | Retry with backoff; then an honest error message. |
| Sheets unavailable | Chat still answers; feedback falls back to a local file and the UI warns that it may not persist. A feedback-store outage must never take down Q&A. |
| Tool-iteration cap hit | Answer with what was gathered, stating it was truncated. |

The through-line: **degrade to "I couldn't answer," never to a confident wrong number.**

## 9. Testing

- `tests/test_db.py` — the guardrail is a security path, so it gets real coverage: rejects `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DROP`/`ATTACH`/multi-statement; enforces the row cap; a known-count query is stable (MRV Semester 1 = 7,702 delivered session rows).
- `tests/test_build.py` — Excel-serial → timestamp conversion (a known serial maps to a known date); `deviation` view returns the expected MRV overlap (1,174 units).
- `tests/test_agent.py` — a golden set with the OpenRouter call mocked, asserting tool-call shape and that answers cite SQL.

**The golden set must span the breadth of the store, not one question shape.** At least two questions per area: content, catalogue, sessions/delivery, feedback/ratings, instructors, course-crosswalk, designed-vs-delivered, and one open-ended advisory. This set is the regression suite for capability — if a whole area has no golden question, that area's coverage is unverified. Live-model accuracy is judged by the feedback loop, not unit tests.

## 10. Deliberate simplifications (YAGNI)

- **No auto-learning.** Feedback is captured, not applied. The loop is deferred until we know what people ask and whether answers are good — teaching it from an unvalidated 👍 risks entrenching a wrong query.
- No vector search / embeddings — nothing is retrieved in v1, and when the loop returns, notes will be small enough to inject wholesale.
- No auth in the app itself — Streamlit Cloud viewer restriction is the access control.
- No multi-user session state or conversation persistence — chat history lives in `st.session_state` for the session only.
- No agent-written charts in v1 — text answers + tables. Add plots once the questions being asked are known.
- No Postgres — DuckDB rebuilt at startup, per the parent design doc's upgrade path.

## 11. Phasing

1. **Data**: `build_delivered.py`, `build_designed.py`, `load_duckdb.py` extensions + views, and `docs/data-dictionary.md`. *Done when:* every table and column in the store is described in the dictionary, and the `deviation` view reproduces the MRV numbers we already computed by hand (1,174 overlap, 154 dropped).
2. **Agent core**: `db.py` guardrails + `agent.py` loop, driven from a CLI. *Done when:* the golden set — spanning **all** areas of the store, not just deviation — answers correctly with valid SQL.
3. **UI + feedback**: `app.py` chat, per-response 👍/👎 + improvement box, Sheets append. *Done when:* a submitted rating appears as a row in the Sheet, and a Sheets outage does not break chat.
4. **Deploy**: private repo, Streamlit Cloud, secrets, viewer allowlist.

## 12. Open questions

1. **Which OpenRouter model** for the agent? Needs tool-calling + decent SQL. To be picked by running the golden set against 2–3 candidates on accuracy vs cost.
2. **Who owns the Google service account / Sheet** for the feedback log? Blocks phase 3. If unavailable, fall back to a committed CSV or a small hosted DB.
3. **Repo visibility** — must be confirmed private before deploy (§7).

## 13. Deferred to v2 — the learning loop

Cut from v1 by decision, not oversight. The `feedback_log` row already captures everything needed to build it: question, SQL, answer, verdict, and the user's improvement text.

When it returns, the likely shape is the one from the parent design doc §6:
- **Correction notes** — human-written facts ("exclude BREAK sessions", "MRV = Malla Reddy Vishwavidyapeeth") injected verbatim into the system prompt. Low risk; probably first.
- **Q→SQL few-shot examples** — promoted from 👍'd answers. Higher risk: a plausible-but-wrong query that earned a 👍 would teach the agent a bad pattern, and this store has real footguns (the course crosswalk, dash-less `session_id`). If added, it needs human curation, not auto-promotion.

**Trigger to build it:** enough logged feedback to show a recurring question shape the agent gets wrong. Not a date.
